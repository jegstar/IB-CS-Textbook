# Flowcharts

A flowchart is a way of visually representing an algorithm. The whole point of a flowchart is to represent the movement that goes through a program. It should be a step by step representation of a program. They are used in many differnet situations but are quite common to map out program design in Computer Science.

An example would be the following:

In this example, you can see a real life example of a flowchart for making a cup of tea. You can see as a visual representation of the process for making it. There are shapes, connected by arrows, that represent different parts of the process. The shapes are shown as follows:

|Shape|Name|Description|Python|
|---|---|---|---|
|![terminator](assets\terminator.png)|Terminator|Starts and finishes the flowchart|```nothing for this!```|
|![process](assets\process.png)|Process|This represents some change in the internal state of the program. In Python it is normally a line of code that contains the = sign|```x = 10```|
|![input output](assets\io.png)|Input / Output|This represents some input or output in the program. It could be from the user or |```x = 10```|
